# Data Visualization Project
Created a Shiny App dashboard and a Tableau dashboard in order to find more information about an eCommerce and the relationship between the columns (this was done through Tableau). Afterwards, I used Shiny in order to create a linear regression model to predict Gross Sales depending on different product types.
